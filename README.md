Tri-Mesh-Terrain-Generator.
A simple, psuedo-terrain generator that uses semi-random displacements.
This uses triangles instead of quads. The meshes aren't perfect, but overall
it seems to work ok.
NOTE: The image save is set for Windows-it sends the image to the C:\ drive.
You will have to change it in the code for different platforms.
